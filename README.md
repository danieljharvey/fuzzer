# ts-boilerplate
Starting point for TS projects as I keep doing this a lot

Commands:

`yarn test` - Tests

`yarn test:watch` - Tests in watch mode

`yarn tsc` - Typescript, once

`yarn tsc:watch` - Typescript in watch mode

`yarn tsc:check` - Typescript in watch mode, don't bother making files though
